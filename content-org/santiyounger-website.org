** A New Modern Philosophy I've been playing with an idea a while.
   *What if I started a movement for a modern school of thought?* It would be a philosophy for creators. I would name this philosophy Davincism in honor to the greatest creator of all time Leonardo DaVinci. 

** What Is Davincism And Who Is It For?
   Davincism would become a modern philosophy for creators who unlike the very well established counterparts "specialists" can't or don't want to focus on just one interest. 

   *It is a philosophy with the aim to bring together all types of creative people* who want to learn how to be their true self. Davincism promotes the idea to combine most or all of your interests into your creative output. 

** Who Is This Philosophy Not For?
   Even thought they can still learn from *Davincism this philosophy is not made for specialist.* Davincism doesn't treat specialists as the enemies. This philosophy aims to fix what for centuries has been a world that only praises those who can "focus" and specialize on just one field. 

** The Multi-Niche Method
   This modern philosophy is very much aimed for you, if you want to create content online. If your goal is to: - Work For Yourself - Start A Business - Create A Personal Brand Then this creative philosophy is for you. The multi-niche method is a rebellion against the common /"you need to niche down"/ advice that we all hear everywhere.
   *There's no denying on the monetary advantages of a niche,* specialization is a great approach to creative work, but it's not the only way.

   The multi-niche method teaches how to make it as someone with various interests, and use that creative power to your advantage, this could take the form of combining various niches or of finding a way to innovate on all of them simultaneously. This is a concept I'm still expanding on, if you'd like to learn more feel free to contact me.

** What Term Is Used To Describe A Follower Of Davincism? 
   Someone who practices the concepts of Davincism would be called a /Davincist./ You can start calling yourself a Davincist from the moment you choose to, this is not a religious movement, nor a private club. My hope is to make Davincism a established idea that anyone who doesn't want to follow in specialization can adopt.

** A Short Note On Our Hero Leonardo
   As we all know DaVinci is one of the most brilliant geniuses that humanity has sees. There might be thousands of people like him right now, who’s goals and ambitions have never been able to reached Leonardo’s level of achievements and admiration.

   Perhaps you (just like me) have also been *envious of Leonardo’s ability to line up all of his talents* and pass to history as the most successful Polymath. DaVinci had an incredible ability to work on an infinite amount of different fields of study, including: 

   - Art 
   - Science 
   - Architecture 
   - Anatomy 
   - Engineering 
   - Philosophy


   The list goes on, almost to the extent where you could mention any field of study and research on how DaVinci made some mayor contributions to it.
 
** The Times When People Like DaVinci Were Admired 
   Leonardo didn't have an easy life, but he was born in a time where being a generalist was admired. The Renaissance man, was someone who has many talents, someone who had the ability to aquiere a higher knowledge in many fields of study.

** The Rise Of Specialization The Downfall Of Generalists 
   Unlike today, being a single talented specialist wasn't very admirable. *We lost our way with the rise of industrialization* where we created a market that treats us as productivity machines more than actual humans, filled with curiosity and a desire to learn.

** Nature Vs Nurture
   It's hard to tell if some of us are born to have several interests, or if it's a personality trait we acquire. Some say we are all born with infinite curiosity and society pushes us down the funnel of specialization, (this is not too hard to believe) weather you think you were born like this, or if it's a choice, let me encourage you to be who you want to be to the fullest. 

** Many Terms To Describe Someone Like DaVinci
   Davincism is a term that aim to unify all the different ways in which people like as are referred to. Just to mention a few:

   - Jack of All Trades
   - Generalist
   - Polymath
   - Multipotentialite
   - Scanner

** Why A New Term?
   Unfortunately, some of the terms used to describe have the intention to look down on us. Jack of All Trades is something used to describe someone unfocused, Generalist is someone who can't specialize. 

   Polymath is an amazing term, yet not well know and difficult to understand just by reading it. Davincism is a term that can be understood from just reading it. 

   Most people know who Leonardo DaVinci is, he is recognized as a genius and it's an empowering term for those of use who want to be more like DaVinci and become the true versions of ourselves with all of our interests and passions.

** What's Next 
   Considering that you are on board with this new philosophy, *you can become a practicing Davincist from this moment onward.* Of course using a new term won't chance your life just like that, but it's a start. y thoughts on this new philosophy are in progress. If you would like to find out more how to be a successful Davincist I'd love to help, feel free to contact me, let's create a movement together.

  There's an interesting [[#eponymous-200806][Eponymous law]]. called Segal's law, that illustrates how too much information makes us insecure to share our work.
** Segal's Law
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: segals-law-200806
   :END:
 Segal’s Law states:
> “A man with a watch knows what time it is. A man with two watches is never sure.”

 Having too much information can often make a decision more difficult instead of easier.

 This is also related to the paradox of choice, *which overwhelms us and makes us regret any choice we ever make.* since we fall intro the trap of thinking that the alternative choice would have been better.
 
** Share Your Work Improve It As You Go
  If like me you are trying to create meaningful content online. Or if you have a project you've been wanting to share, just do it.

  Publish your work, it doesn't matter how imperfect it seems. The sooner we understand perfection is unachievable the better we'll be.

  Start small, improve as you go, and most of all trust that what you know today is good enough to start.
  
  There's an amazing [[https://sive.rs/infinity][blogpost ]]by [[https://sive.rs][Derek Sivers]] that helps illustrate this point perfectly.

Recently I learned how to write HTML code inside of ox-hugo thanks to this amazing [[file:~/Zotero/storage/289Z3CW7/hugo-raw-html-shortcode.html][short blog-post]].

This feature seems to work natively inside of ox-hugo without the need to put it in an HTML block.
 
This should work just as well for regular HTML, as well as regular Hugo, this is not a special feature of ox-hugo, but it works great in it and that's where I'm using it.

This is really useful for times when you want to write about something optional for your audience to read, without interrupting the flow of the blog-post.

It can also be used for adding long code.

Or in any other creative way you can think of.

** How to Do it.
 Create an opening "details" tag like so:
#+BEGIN_SRC
<details>
#+END_SRC 

Define the text you want it to show with "summary" tag like so:
#+BEGIN_SRC
<summary>
#+END_SRC 
write what you want to display as a folding title and then close the "summary" tag.

#+BEGIN_SRC
</summary>
#+END_SRC 
Insert all the text you want to insert.

And then close the "details" tag.

#+BEGIN_SRC
</details>
#+END_SRC 

** This Is How The Code Would Look Like


    #+BEGIN_SRC

* Philosopher's Walk 30 Day Challenge                            :philosophy:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION: posts
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: walk-think
:END:
I've decided to do a experiment. I'm doing a 30 day walk challenge. 

I'll call it "Philosopher's Walk Challenge"

> “I can only meditate when I am walking. When I stop, I cease to think; my mind only works with my legs.” 
>- Jean-Jacque Rousseau

For the past years I've been obsessed with philosophy, particularly Stoicism. In my journey towards learning about all types of philosophers I've come across the fact that the best thinkers trusted in the power of walks to free their mind from stress and replace that stress for creativity.

I've never been an avid walker. This time I want to take walks where I detach from my phone, that means no music, no audio-books, no podcast, just thoughts.

*** Rules

   > No phone allowed
   
   > Company is permitted
 
** Day 1
    During this walk I didn't try to purposefully think about any problem in particular. Naturally my urge to turn everything I do into some creative idea lead me down a strange path.

 I wanted to do this 30 day walk challenge to build the habit of walking. I thought it would be cool to write a blogpost about my experience.
 This quickly got out of control into the following thoughts.

 
- I can track my daily thoughts
- I can measure data on things like time, distance
- I can go even further, tracking my mood per day
  

   It quickly got out of hand into the full fledged blogpost that you are reading right now.
 
** Day 2 
   I had a bit of a stressful walk, it started alright and it was great to be out after a busy day. In the middle of the walk I remembered I need to sort out some freelance tax stuff urgently, so I was anxious to go back home quickly to sort it out.

Thankfully, since I was walking my dog Zizu with my girlfriend I had a nice talk with her and did the best to relax. Now that I am hope I sorted taxes out and feel a better. I can't wait for tomorrow's walk though.
** Day 3
   Walk in nature with girlfriend, mom and my dog Zizu, amazing experience much needed.
   
We went to a beautiful river which is 30 minutes drive away, that's the best part of Ecuador amazing nature not so far away from home.

** Day 4
   I couldn't sleep last night, I was overthinking, not necessarily stressful stuff. I was having tons of ideas, my ideas where having ideas. This is often exciting, but when feeling sleep deprived something I doubt my ability to excuse this ideas.

Today I've been feeling tired after a bad night sleep. I value sleep more than I value most things, so even thought I was feeling a bit lazy for this walk, I had a great time walking Zizu, and letting the ideas flow.

I even came up with a nice sounding quote:

>Don't let insecurities hide behind what looks like resonable excuses.
   
** Day 5
I was getting obsessed over learning a certain subject that I'm passionate about, I hit a wall of overwhelm, this is where thankfully I forced myself to go for a walk.

** Day 6
   I was feeling pretty stressed, I'm happy I forced myself to go for this walk. I feel a bit overwhelmed by certain stressful things I need to do, but I can definitely see how the walk helped free some tension.
** Day 7
   I usually go for my walk in the afternoon. I started experiencing some anxiety during the morning. I just came back from it and I do feel better than I did. I've been feeling overwhelmed this last couple of days. I know there will be days where I don't see the point in walking nor on keeping this log of my thoughts. 

I just have to trust that the walk will benefit me, and that this track of my thoughts might help someone else as well to do the same.   
** Day 8
   Today was satisfying, I had a productive work session, I actually finshed video editing project that process that usually takes me over 3 hours in almost half the time. Going for my daily walk felt like a nice transition to the next things I want to do with my day. I'm in a good mood right now, ready to take onto more fullfiling work.

Hey my name is Santi.
 [[file:../static/about/about-me-1-big.jpg]]

I am a Jack of All Trades with several interests. Yet they all have one thing in common.
I learn to create and I create so that I can learn.

Here are some of my top interests:

- Stoic Philosophy
- Note Taking Systems
- Polymath
- Web-Design
- Linux
- Film-making 
- Animation
- Photography
- Constructed Languages
- Street Magic
 
here's a quick list of weird ways to describe myself.

- Lover of wisdom
- Ideas aficionado
- Obsessive learner
- Devoted life-liver
- Creativity enthusiast
- Lifestyle philosopher
- And a learn as you teach kind of guy

If That Didn't Make You Roll Your Eyes, Wait There's More...
I could tell you:

- what I studied
- where I'm from
- where I live
- etc...
 
At the end of the day none of those things define who I am.

** The Way We Introduce Ourselves Is Based On Boring Tags
 Yes, we can describe the boring stuff if we wish, but most of those tags are things we do, they are not who we are.

 So if you are going to use tags, then make them interesting.

 Write something ridiculously epic.

*** I am a ---(fill in epic list)---
 I challenge you to write a ridiculous description like the one I made. Send me an email and introduce yourself that way.


 Name the subject line of the email:
 Epic Intro ---Insert your name---

I've been working for the past month on rebuilding this website. It used to be hand-coded on pure HTML and CSS, but the time it took me to maintain that system was not sustainable.

Now I'm super happy with my new set up. (which is still under construction.)

I use [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] in [[https://www.spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]] to write and organize everything. I export everything to this website with [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]], with the help of the [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]] theme called [[https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-color-your-world/][Color Your World]].

* TODO Found my tool for teaching 
  I've been obsessed about creating an advanced note-taking system. This is more than simple notes, it's a knowledge base for creative people.

I've spent the past couple of years exploring all types of apps and tools. Like most people I've gone through using things such as EverNote, OneNote and all these popular apps. After going hardcore into finding something more powerful I ended up learning everything I could about power user tools made for programmers such as Vim and Emacs.

I'm actually building this website from emacs (more specifically Spacemacs with hugo and ox-hugo) I've come a long way. 

I've come to a place where I use tools such as the all powerful org-mode in emacs with the most powerful package called org-roam. Now that I've come to the point where I want to teach everything I know for someone who wants to build a powerful knolwdge base out of their notes, I realize the huge task it would be to teach tools such as vim and emacs. 

I've been exploring tools that offer power user features, but are also user friendly for someone starting out.

I've been looking for the following essential features:

- Future Proof (You own your files)
- Vim Keybindings (Power user shortcuts to never touch the mouse)
- Interconnection of notes (For building a non-hierarchical system which replicates the way our brain works
- bidirectional linking (backlinks)

I think I finally found the tool I'll use to teach everything I know to creative people who are non-programmers who want to become power users when it comes to building their second brains, digital garden or personal wiki.

The tools is Obsidian. You'll be hearing more about my lunch course teaching everything I know using this amazing tool.

  In open-source software there's the idea of rollback version, this means that if you use a particular software and the developers make version 2.0 you have the choice to go back to version 1.0 if you want to.

Imagine what it would be like if we could do that with the internet as a whole. I'm talking about a point in time where you could watch a video online without being advertised and click-baited every 5 seconds.

** Internet Version 1.0

Internet v.10 consist of a time where you could search for something online without ending up with the feeling that you are doing everything wrong,* and that your life we'll forever be a mess if you don't get a personal coach.
 
*What if we went back to this Internet version 1.0, would that make a better world?*

 I'm not sure, it wouldn't allow so many people to seek independance by starting their online businesses. The Internet back there wasn't the interconnected web of knowledge that now is.

Perhaps the lack of mentally destructive social media is the best feature of version 1.0
 
** Internet Version 2.0

    Version 2.0 is a money making machine, if you want to find blogs that are made for the love of knowledge and sharing thoughts, you might have to make your way to the depths of the Internet, in order to find something great. *Most online content is made with the intention to be monetized.* 

** What Can We Do About It?
I am no exception to some inherent parts of version 2.0. I want to share what I create, *I want to help people who are interested in the same things as I am, and I want to be more independent.* 

Creating content online and finding an ethical way to monetize it, is a great feature to empower people to create. Unfortunately there's a lot of ways in which this can go wrong.

** We Can't Go Back To Version 1.0, So What Can We Do?

 Perhaps we'll never be able to roll-back to version 1.0, so we might as well talk about how to improve our use of version 2.0

 This is something that I'm still trying to find out, some of the questions that content creators must as are:
 
** Questions For Creators

 - How can I build a brand founded on trust?
 - How can I be more authentic with my work?
 - If I want to make a living out of this, how can I make it in an ethical way?
 
** Questions Consuming Online Content
 - Am I getting value from the content I consume online?
 - Is the Internet helping me achieve what I want, or is it distracting me too much?
 - Do I feel empowered by my use of the Internet, or am I constantly feeling inadequate?
   

  Only by asking better questions can we merge version 1.0 and 2.0 together, into something that benefits as, both as creators and learners.

** Inspiration For This Post
  
 I was going through [[https://www.taniarascia.com/another-website-redesign/][Tania Rascia's]] amazing blog and I came across [[https://www.taniarascia.com/another-website-redesign/][this blogpost]] in it she talks about how the old Internet used to be. She also talks about delivering free content without ads to an audience, just because she loves to create.

 I think here philosophy on content creation is admirable, a lot of her content is on web-development and programming, if you are interested in that kind of awesome stuff, I highly recommend [[https://www.taniarascia.com/another-website-redesign/][checking out her website.]]

 Ever since I decided to redesign my website with ox-hugo, my mind has been blown.

I've had to work with a couple of workarounds to do exactly what I need.

Among this things I wanted to find a way to include HTML into my org-file.

Initially I thought I'd be able to get away with the following due to org-mode functionality.

~#+BEGIN_SRC HTML~

I'd write HTML code in between this tags.

~#+END_SRC~


*Of course this didn't work* since ox-hugo exports to markdown and markdown doesn't support this feature.

** How To Do It?

I wasn't able to find anything in the documentation, but thanfully I stambled upon an amazing [[file:~/Zotero/storage/289Z3CW7/hugo-raw-html-shortcode.html][short blog-post]], which taught me exactly how to include HTML. This tutorial is made with Hugo using Markdown, thankfully it works exactly the same for ox-hugo without any extra steps.

The following steps are fully attributed to the author of the blogpost [[https://anaulin.org][Ana Ulin]], so thanks to Ana for this.

The way to do it is how to your hugo directroy 
in my case I have mine in

/home/user/hugo/santiyounger

go to layouts

in there create a new folder called "shortcode"

then create a file and call it rawhtml.html 

edit the file with your favorite editor ;) 
and add the following to it:

#+BEGIN_SRC
<!-- raw html -->
{{.Inner}}
#+END_SRC 

now go to your org mode file where you edit your ox-hugo webiste.

Choose a place where you want to insert some HTML
open the HTML with:

~{{< rawhtml >}}~
and end it with:
~{{< /rawhtml >}}~

# I need  to define <code> inside my css to achieve this

 I found this extremely useful for migrating my old blog-posts into this new ox-hugo website set-up, since most of my old content was formatted in in HTML. 
 
Of course the reason why you might need this is to work with css. Which is one of the biggest reasons to set this up.

** Intro
  Why are we encouraged to separate life and work?
It makes sense on the surface, but why should they be so separate?

Is it healthy to devide ourselves into two?
Should we then have two moralities? The Professional one, and the individual one?

** Why is work life balance such a popular concept
Work life balance is a side effect of a society that doesn't enocurage us to do what we love for a living, nor does it push us to show more of who we are into our work.

Therfore we are often encpuraged to divide our proffessional lives from our personal one. 

** Modern enterprise
Thankfully there are a lot of companies, that have started to wake up to the fact that their employees are humans, but here in Ecuador South America where I live, I think this reality is still very distant.
** Falling victim for the system
If you've fallen victim of the system, then you must abosilutly separate your work from your life, to remain mentally sane, but what if you want to find a way to integrate more of who you are into the work that you do?

** enjoying work
It might sound insensite to say this, but shouldn't we strive for enjoying our work for it's own sake rather than to simply make money to survive. Granted there's a lot of people in the world who still need to work really hard so that they can put a bread in the table, that is a reality, but there's a lot of people just strive for what other people want (money and fame) rather than search for fullfilment into ones work.

If you want to integrate more of who you are into your work, you are not alone, let's figure out what steps to take.

** Sciene and energy to work
In thermochemistry there's a difference between exergonic and endergonic reaction:

**Exergonic:** You need to keep adding energy to keep the process running.
**Endergonic:** The process continues after it's been triggered and even generates energy of it's own.
This is the difference between:

*Being Pulled vs Pushing Forward*

Being pulled forward to do our work through a satisfying process.

** Independance
   I've studied a lot of practical philosophy, mostly Stoicism and I've learned that the main reason why we suffer is when we try to control what's outside of our control.
   
It doesn't matter who you work for, as long as you work for someone else, you are putting a lot of your time in someone else's hands. Not every job is bad, perhaps you are one of the lucky few who works in an amazing evironment, but I believe that for most people the solution is to put more of your work into your own hands.

This isually implies finding a way to be more independant. Freelance, starting a business, coaching, writting and many other things might be the solution towards more autonomy.

Yet all of this things are scary. Finding a way to find fiancial autonmy is a process for which one blog post will not suffice.

One of the best resources I've ever found on the transition between day job towards autonomy is a book by one of my mentors Sean Wes overlap

* TODO Keeping Track of Words, and writing as a habit 
  
# Show table of contents for someone olny here for notion, write a heads up on skipping sections

In 2018 I was inspired by [[https://seanwes.com/about/][Sean McCabe]] to write more, way more. His philosophy entails that *writing is the process where any form of creation begins.* 

** It All Starts With Writing 
   
It doesn't matter what you do, whether that's blogging, video-editing, art or any other creative field it all starts with writing.

If you want to make a film you have to write a script. If you want to give a talk you have to write it first.

It starts with writing and before that that it starts with a solid system of note-taking.

"Notes aren't a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking process."

–Richard Feynman

# give more examples
** Are There Any Exceptions Where Writing Can Be Skipped?

 Most outputs of creative expression start with writing. But you may ask. What if I make YouTube videos can't I just skip the writing part? Yes, you can, but the quality of your thinking and of your outcome will drastically improved if you at least outline what you'll say. 

 It's the same thing for podcasting for instance. I've done over 50 episodes on Stoic Philosophy for my main podcast. A lot of the old episodes where unscripted, but the quality of my thoughts and ideas are far superior when I at least outline my thinking process.

 I'd love to expand on the advantages of writing as part of your creative process, but that is part of a further conversation I wish to follow.
 # link to other articles or tags 
   
*** Writers Write   
 Painters paint, photographers take photos and writers write. You don't need to call yourself a writer in order reap its benefits. If I already convinced you that writing is the place where your creative process starts then now we must talk about quantity and quality.

*** Quantity Produces Quality
 A lot of us often debate about quality vs quantity, it's a common debate we don't want to sacrifice the quality of our work because we fear we'll be seen as bad creators. Truth is that quantity produces quality. The more you do something the better you'll get at it.

 The more you write the better of a writer you'll become, the more of your work you put out there for others to observer, the more productive feedback you'll get and the faster you'll improve.
   
*** Why Track The Amount Of Words I Write?
   
 Is it necessary to track the amount of words you write, per day, month year or even decade? The way I see this is as a motivational tool, a reminded that I'm putting the work. Whenever I feel demotivated or frustrated at my work at least I can see how many words I've written in the months so far and feel a sense of motion towards my goals.

 # write more about the nerdiest of tracking data as a fun hobby
*** Tracking Daily Word Count
 Considering that you've been convinced of the advantages of tracking your daily word count, now it's time to consider how to achieve this.

 - Spacemacs
 - Notion
 
*** What is Spacemacs?
   Spacemacs is a combination of the 2 most powerful tools created by humans, this are Vim and Emacs. This programs are most commonly used by programmers, but writers and content creators are really missing out, unfortunately it takes a learning curve, but once you learn the power of this tool, there's no going back. Your productivity level will sky rocket.

 The fact that it's open source and free means that everything you write in it is 100% yours. Since it relies on writing in plain text, you can be sure that everything you write today is accessible to you in the coming 50 years and more.

 # plug consulting on spacemacs for writers

 # write about spacemacs as a replacement to scriviner 
   
*** What Is Notion?
 Notion is a note-taking app with infinity functions such as
 - Content Management System
 - Air-tables (spreadsheets on steroids)
 - Task Manager
 
 In some ways it's a user friendly version of the power-tools I mentioned above like Emacs and Spacemacs, but with some amazing features that makes it 10x more accessible to beginners and even useful for power users.

 The reasons to use Notion instead of spacemacs is

 - for collaboration with others.
 - Spreadsheets on steroids
 
  With the function of spreadsheets on steroid (called databases in notion) we can make a table to keep track of our daily words and create formulas to get words per week, month, year.
 
*** Using your writing app to keep track of word count   

 How does this process look like on daily basis.

 1. I write my content
 2. I create a temporary document called word count
 3. I copy past what I write on the day to my word count document
 4. I write down in Notion the word count number at the end of the day.
 
 I do this in spacemacs, my process involves a power feature of spacemacs called org-capture, while allows to quickly send text to a specific document.

 At the end of the day I see how many words I've pasted into this temporary document. I write down the final number and delete the file to have it read for the next day.

   
  # spacemacs consulting
 # notion consulting

*** Common Issues
   
 There's still one common issue that I'm working on solving with this current workflow. 
 What if I'm editing and adding new words to a previous piece of work?

 Then the word count isn't so obvious, it would be hard to keep track of which words were written today and which one's where written in a previous day.

 I'm sure that spacemacs has either a function, package or way to track daily words. Even if there's nothing pre-made as I improve my skill to write code (elisp) I can configure something that works for me.

 In the meantime I am okay with having my daily word count being inexact and mostly an approximation, at least for now.


*** But Wait I don't use Spacemacs?
   
 Spacemacs is like I mentioned before a power user tool that will completely change the way you think about inputting text into your computer. Writers can have drastic benefits by learning to use it.

 Yet I must admit I did have to spend hour on end in order to learn how to use it. I got myself deeper into programming and configuring things to my liking, it quickly became an obsession.

*** online courses as a business model
    I am starting to understand the following when it comes to creating content online.
  
  Creating  free content builds a brand, consistency leads people to come back to consume more content on that subject.

  Trust is monetizable because advertisers are looking for people with influence. Advertisers look for creators who are trusted by an audience so that they can sell things by using the creators credibility.

  Therefore a common income stream relies on creators getting  eyeballs on their work, so that they can attract sponsors and advertise to their audience.

  This is not a bad business model, but recently I realized that as a Jack of all trades with an umbrella brand (one that focuses on several niches, rather than specializing in one) the sponsor business model although not impossible it's harder to achieve if you keep changing focus on what you create.

  This is why I've started planning selling educational digital products, for instance ebooks or online courses.

  # independance
  # self reliance
