      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s an interesting Eponymous law. called Segal&amp;rsquo;s law, that illustrates how too much information makes us insecure to share our work.
Segal&amp;rsquo;s Law  Segal’s Law states:
 “A man with a watch knows what time it is. A man with two watches is never sure.”
 Having too much information can often make a decision more difficult instead of easier.
This is also related to the paradox of choice, which overwhelms us and makes us regret any choice we ever make.</description>
