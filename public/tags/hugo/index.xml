      <description>Recently I learned how to write HTML code inside of ox-hugo thanks to this amazing short blog-post.
This feature seems to work natively inside of ox-hugo without the need to put it in an HTML block.
This should work just as well for regular HTML, as well as regular Hugo, this is not a special feature of ox-hugo, but it works great in it and that&amp;rsquo;s where I&amp;rsquo;m using it.</description>
