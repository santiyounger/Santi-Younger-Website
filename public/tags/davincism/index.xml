      <description>A New Modern Philosophy  I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with an idea a while. What if I started a movement for a modern school of thought, a philosophy for creators.

 Having too much information can often make a decision more difficult instead of easier.
This is also related to the paradox of choice, which overwhelms us and makes us regret any choice we ever make.</description>
