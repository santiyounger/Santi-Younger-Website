      <description>Whenever you are creating something, weather it&amp;rsquo;s: writing, video editing, drawing or any form of creation keep this in mind: Less is more.
Make removing the fluff into a habit. No piece of art was achieved in the first try.
Perfection (or something close to it) is usually found in subtraction not addition.
Think of sculpture, where the artist removes the rock to find his masterpiece. Think like a sculptor.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not just ideas that matter, it&amp;rsquo;s how they make us feel. We often hear the classic: &amp;ldquo;Ideas have no value unless you execute on them.&amp;quot; This makes sense from a monetary stand point, but ideas have the power to bring us joy, energy and life, if that isn&amp;rsquo;t meaningful I don&amp;rsquo;t know what is.
Learn to respect your ideas for the inherent value that they have.
Execute on the best ones, but don&amp;rsquo;t look down on the ones you don&amp;rsquo;t act on.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the combination and excitement that determines when something is worth pursing.
Excitement by itself is not sufficient, Fear by itself might be something we are afraid to do, but it&amp;rsquo;s not even something that will give us the benefits we seek.
It&amp;rsquo;s in the combination of both of these that we find what we must do.

plural metonymies. Men are trash, sounds as if saying all men are trash.
When we attribute a concept to a large group. It&amp;rsquo;s a dangerous generalization without much consideration. Dictionary:
 &amp;ldquo;A figure of speech consisting of the use of the name of one thing for that of another of which it is an attribute or with which it is associated (such as &amp;ldquo;crown&amp;rdquo; in &amp;ldquo;lands belonging to the crown&amp;rdquo;)&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Character Character is the ability to keep going even after the initial rush of excitement has passed.
This relates to the idea of quitting and persisting. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to know when we should keep going and when to be wise enough to quit.
Quitting is not an act of weakness, quitting can be a great idea when we realize we are not moving forward to where we want to go.</description>

      <description>As much as all of us trust in programs such as Microsoft Word, pages and note taking apps. We must understand something important if we care about preserving our work throughout the years.
When a new version of an application updates, old files become difficult to read, they must be converted to be accessed. If the company you trust decides to make your old files obsolete, it will mean a lot of work in order for you to save them, worst casenario you will lose them.</description>

Unfortunately the story is not true.
The people at NASA are not that dumb. They where fully aware of the pencil as an alternative. It turns out that pencils are dangerously flammable in space. If the tip breaks and gets lost in the spaceship it can cause serious problems. Paul C. Fisher developed the zero gravity pen which was approved by NASA and used in space.</description>

This is the introvert&amp;rsquo;s fear, and often the reason why we have to think twice before committing to hang out with someone.</description>

      <description>There is a difference between the two following ways to operate a business online:
  Creating free content that attracts the right clients.
  Creating free content without a plan, to make things sustainable.
Number 1 relies on a well thought-out strategy to attract the right people to become part of your business.
  Number 2 might be a good way to get used to creating, but it&amp;rsquo;s by no means a business model by itself.</description>

The idea is to determine something we would like to improve in our lives, it could be internal or external.

      <description>Clarity will allow you to be pulled out of bed in the morning. It allows you to be driven to do what fulfills you.
Clarity on your vision makes the difference. When you have clarity you don&amp;rsquo;t need to push through in hard times. During adversity, clarity is the force that pull you to keep going.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t experience this yet, you probably haven&amp;rsquo;t figured out your why yet.</description>

      <description>The concept of genius comes from the Greeks. Genius wasn&amp;rsquo;t something that was always attributed to people.
People admired artists and innovators, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t attribute their genius to them. Genius was an external force that inspired them, they were called daemons. Some type of force or even a creature, think of Dobby from Harry Potter.

In our solitude in the understanding of this questions we will eventually reach an answer. These answers cannot be forced, we must learn to live the questions themselves.</description>

      <description>We can&amp;rsquo;t say: I&amp;rsquo;m the most humble person I know it defeats the purpose.
Maybe accepting that we&amp;rsquo;ll never be as humble as we wish we were is a place to start. Ironically that might take me in the direction we seek towards humility (but don&amp;rsquo;t let ego know, he&amp;rsquo;ll get all proud and mess things up).

      <description>In Greece artists were thought to have an external genius. Having an external source of inspiration meant that the ego of artists didn&amp;rsquo;t grow uncontrollably.
Their genius wasn&amp;rsquo;t only theirs. People didn&amp;rsquo;t praise just them, but also their external genius.

      <description>When experiencing doubt, overwhelm, contradictions or unanswered questions that conflict me I can start saying:
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know the answer to that, let&amp;rsquo;s keep living to find out.&amp;quot;
It trains the muscle of humility, the one that allows us to keep learning from life, instead of believing we can come up with concrete conclusions every time.

It is important to remind ourselves of the limitations of our power, not to fool ourselves with projections of our ego.

There was a little kid who seemed to be lost, she couldn&amp;rsquo;t find her mom.
We approached her and asked her.
Where&amp;rsquo;s your mom, are you lost?
She said, I&amp;rsquo;m not lost, I am here, my mom is the one that&amp;rsquo;s lost.
Her mom found her a few seconds after that. That phrase became an inside joke in my family, but I guess she had a point.</description>

This plays with your ego, even though few achieve it, it&amp;rsquo;s designed for most to fail.

      <description>My girlfriend and I have lived in this rented shared house for a few months. The room gets extremely cold at night.
There always seems to be a breeze passing through the window. Today was extremely windy. I was going to put tape or something on whatever is causing so much wind to pass through. Today I discovered that at the very top, there&amp;rsquo;s a hidden plastic thing.
You move it in a strange way and you fully block the passage of wind.</description>

      <description>Babies ask for what they want by making crying noises, screaming or making some random sound.
When their parents give them everything without asking an effort from the baby, the baby takes longer to learn to talk.
They get complaisant, they thing that making crying noises is enough. They no longer make an effort to learn.

      <description>Dolphins refer to each other by name. They emit certain sounds to call and identify other dolphins.
There have been studies to determine if they have specific words for several things. Due to their high pitch sounds, most of them are not within the human hearing range so it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to determine.

      <description>Different languages have different way to great. In English we might ask &amp;ldquo;how are you&amp;rdquo; we don&amp;rsquo;t really care about how the person is, it&amp;rsquo;s just a greeting.
In other languages one might say &amp;ldquo;What is your age&amp;rdquo; as a form of greeting. This is used because in order to know what pronoun to us one need to know the other person&amp;rsquo;s age.

      <description>Changing and improving yesterday&amp;rsquo;s opinion for better ones is a good form of contradictions.
what we must avoid is inconstant beliefs. These are beliefs that stop us from choosing path. They give us paradox of choice.
We must avoid being a victim of foolish consistency. This means doing things that no longer make sense to us. Yet we keep doing them because we don&amp;rsquo;t want to be inconsistent, because that&amp;rsquo;s how we&amp;rsquo;ve always done things.</description>

      <description>We have some predetermined beliefs that have been imposed to us from society, friendships, family and culture.
A lot of these beliefs can be damaging, or self limiting. Getting rid of them is no easy task. What we must become aware of is that there are an infinite amout of beliefs we can adopt. They take time and consistency in order for them to form part of our identity.
The first step is to take a good look at the belief you want to adopt and see how beneficial it will be in your life.</description>

      <description>We must learn to free time to gain clarity.
We feel guilty about saying no to something we don&amp;rsquo;t want to do, because we don&amp;rsquo;t want to hurt the feelings of whoever invited us to do it.
We find it easier to tell someone.
I can&amp;rsquo;t do your thing, because I already committed to something else. Instead of.
No I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do that because I&amp;rsquo;d rather have free time instead.</description>

      <description>We must learn to speak our new truths with conviction, even if it contradicts the past things we&amp;rsquo;ve said.Otherwise we can be stagnant out of fear of being a hypocrite. Instead it&amp;rsquo;s better to admit that we didn&amp;rsquo;t know better.
This also means we will probably learn new truths in the future that contradict the our current ones. This is how growing is done. Don&amp;rsquo;t fear being a hypocrite, if it drives you towards your own growth.</description>

      <description>The story says that NASA spent a decade and $12 billion to build a ballpoint pen that works without gravity. By 1965, scientist found a way to create such pen with a pressurized ink cartridge and compressed nitrogen.
The Russians simply solved this problem by using a pencil. The takeaway is not to over-complicate things, and to look for what&amp;rsquo;s obvious.
Unfortunately, the story is not true, the NASA Pen Story Is False.</description>
