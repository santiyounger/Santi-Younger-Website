## Rebuilding My Website {#rebuilding-my-website}

I've been working for the past month on rebuilding this website. It used to be hand-coded on pure HTML and CSS, but the time it took me to maintain that system was not sustainable.

Now I'm super happy with my new set up. (which is still under construction.)

I use [Org mode](https://orgmode.org/) in [Spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org/) to write and organize everything. I export everything to this website with [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/), with the help of the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme called [Color Your World](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-color-your-world/).

If you want to learn more about how I use this tools feel free to send me a message.
