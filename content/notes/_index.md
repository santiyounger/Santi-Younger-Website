### How Is This Made? {#how-is-this-made}

**_Here are some links to the amazing open-source tools I use:_**

I use [Org mode](https://orgmode.org/) in [Spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org/) to write and organize everything. I export everything to this website with [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/), with the help of the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme [Cortex](https://github.com/jethrokuan/cortex/blob/master/README.org) made by [Jethro Kuan.](https://www.jethro.dev/)

Enjoy your stay!
