The famous story of NASA zero gravity pen [NASA Pen Story]({{< relref "2,0-nasa_pen_story" >}}), is great.

Unfortunately the story is not true.

 ****The people at NASA are not that dumb.**** They where fully aware of the pencil as an alternative.
It turns out that ****pencils are dangerously flammable in space.**** If the tip breaks and gets lost in the spaceship it can cause serious problems.
Paul C. Fisher developed the zero gravity pen which was approved by NASA and used in space. Fisher now sells his very expensive pens online.
