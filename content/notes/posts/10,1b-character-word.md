## Character {#character}

Character is the ability to keep going even after the initial rush of excitement has passed.

**This relates to the idea of quitting and persisting.** It's difficult to know when we should keep going and when to be wise enough to quit.

****Quitting is not an act of weakness,**** quitting can be a great idea when we realize we are not moving forward to where we want to go.

Once you've been able to determine what is worth your time and energy, **then go ahead and use everything you have to push through.** Have the character to persist after the excitement has passed.
