We must learn to free time to gain clarity.

We feel guilty about saying no to something we don't want to do, because we don't want to hurt the feelings of whoever invited us to do it.

We find it easier to tell someone.

I can't do your thing, because I already committed to something else.
Instead of.

No I don't want to do that because I'd rather have free time instead.
