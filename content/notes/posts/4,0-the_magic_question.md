The idea is to create open-ended questions that will stay in the back of our head. This can also be referred as ****direction questions.****

The idea is to determine something we would like to improve in our lives, it could be internal or external.

**Examples:**

**Internal:** How can I feel more calm today?

**External:** How can I make a million dollars this year?

Eventhough it works with external things it's important to consider what's in our control.
What we'll be able to determine is the mindset at the curiosity that will lead us to find an answer.
