As much as all of us trust in programs such as Microsoft Word, pages and note taking apps. We must understand something important if we care about preserving our work throughout the years.

When a new version of an application updates, old files become difficult to read, they must be converted to be accessed. If the company you trust decides to make your old files obsolete, it will mean a lot of work in order for you to save them, worst casenario you will lose them.

Think of what happens to work created and saved in something like floppy discs. Yes, the information might still exist but our ability to use that work easily becomes tedious and sometimes irretrievable.
