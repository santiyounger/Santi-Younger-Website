My girlfriend and I have lived in this rented shared house for a few months. The room gets extremely cold at night.

****There always seems to be a breeze passing through the window.**** Today was extremely windy. I was going to put tape or something on whatever is causing so much wind to pass through. Today I discovered that at the very top, there's a hidden plastic thing.

You move it in a strange way and you fully block the passage of wind. It has always been there, yet it was so hidden, it was hidden at plane sight.

It reminded me that sometimes fixes to our problems are right in front of us. We just need to be more observant.
