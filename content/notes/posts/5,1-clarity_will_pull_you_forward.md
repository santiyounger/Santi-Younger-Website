Clarity will allow you to be pulled out of bed in the morning. ****It allows you to be driven**** to do what fulfills you.

****Clarity on your vision makes the difference.**** When you have clarity you don't need to push through in hard times. During adversity, clarity is the force that pull you to keep going.

If you haven't experience this yet, you probably haven't figured out your why yet.
