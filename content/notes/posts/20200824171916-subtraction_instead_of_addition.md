Whenever you are creating something, weather it's: writing, video editing, drawing or any form of creation keep this in mind: Less is more.

Make removing the fluff into a habit. No piece of art was achieved in the first try.

Perfection (or something close to it) is usually found in subtraction not addition.

Think of sculpture, where the artist removes the rock to find his masterpiece. Think like a sculptor.
