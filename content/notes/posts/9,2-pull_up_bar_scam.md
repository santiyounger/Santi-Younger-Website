There is a pull up bar challenge that scammers set in the streets.
Hang yourself from this pull bar for 100 seconds and win a 100 dollars.

It costed 10 dollars to participate.
Instructions suggested that the bar rotated if you move, if you stay still it doesn't move.

This plays with your ego, even though few achieve it, it's designed for most to fail.

Additionally the bar is really thick covered with grease.
Ego says I can do it, even I just saw stronger people failing.
