We must learn to speak our new truths with conviction, even if it contradicts the past things we've said.Otherwise we can be stagnant out of fear of being a hypocrite. Instead it's better to admit that we didn't know better.

This also means we will probably learn new truths in the future that contradict the our current ones. This is how growing is done. Don't fear being a hypocrite, if it drives you towards your own growth.
