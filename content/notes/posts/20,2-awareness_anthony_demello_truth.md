No one can tell you the truth. Those who claim to know it are lying.

All anyone can do is show you falsehoods. All anyone can do is show you what takes you further from the truth, by avoiding falsehoods we get closer to the truth.

Most of it requieres unlearning the social brain washing we are all subjects to, unlearn something every day  and you will be closer to wisdom.
