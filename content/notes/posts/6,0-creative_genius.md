The concept of genius comes from the Greeks. ****Genius wasn't something that was always attributed to people.****

People admired artists and innovators, but ****they didn't attribute their genius to them****. Genius was an external force that inspired them, they were called ****daemons.****
Some type of force or even a creature, think of Dobby from Harry Potter.
