Yesterday as I was entering the shower. I've taken cold showers in the past for a month straight. I developed the will to be able to do it. But yesterday I was really feeling like taking a hot shower.

The hot water was working and all was good, but all of the sudden the shower failed and I was running out of hot water.

What do you do when you run out of hot water? Do you complaint and quit showering or do you endure the cold? I believe the default response we have to situations like this, makes a difference in our character. After all, how you do anything is how you do everything.

I spent a while trying to turn the shower on and off, hoping it will work, but it didn't, my frustration was growing and my desire for hot water was increasing.

In that moment I noticed how often things we wish for end up controlling us. My ability to adapt was tested. I can take cold showers when I'm in the mindset for them, but this time being out of my control it felt unfair and annoying. I realized that this was just my perfection. I struggled to embraced the cold water, I ended my shower early and realized I can do better next time when things outside of my control go wrong.
