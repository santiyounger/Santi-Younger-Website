Trust in the fact that what you currently struggle with, cannot be answered right now.

To wonder about our flaws as if they were books written in a foreign language, or locked doors. Things we do not understand, but must learn to live with.

In our solitude in the understanding of this questions we will eventually reach an answer. **These answers cannot be forced, we must learn to live the questions themselves.**
