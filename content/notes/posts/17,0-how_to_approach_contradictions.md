****Changing and improving yesterday's opinion for better ones is a good form of contradictions.****

****what we must avoid is inconstant beliefs.**** These are beliefs that stop us from choosing path. They give us paradox of choice.

We must avoid  being a victim of foolish consistency. This means doing things that no longer make sense to us. Yet we  keep doing them because we don't want to be inconsistent, because that's how we've always done things.

We must have the courage to grow out of those and get out of our comfort zone, and contradict our past selves if needed.
