There is a difference between the two following ways to operate a business online:

1.  Creating free content that attracts the right clients.
2.  Creating free content without a plan, to make things sustainable.

    Number 1 relies on a well thought-out strategy to attract the right people to become part of your business.

Number 2 might be a good way to get used to creating, but it's by no means a business model by itself.

Number 2 could  lead to good opportunities, but it's better to have a plan to understand why are you  creating content in the first place.
