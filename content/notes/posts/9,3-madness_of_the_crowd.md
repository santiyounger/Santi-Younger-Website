When we are in public we behave in completely different ways when we are in by our selves and when we are surrounded by our friends.

The other day I was on a train and this group of loud kids were yelling and being rude. Then 3 out of the 4 kids left the train and the one that was left alone, was quietly and peacefully looking out the window.

He was being loud 2 minutes ago, but when we are in solitude we behave completely differently. All of the sudden his body language changed and he looked like a shy kid.
