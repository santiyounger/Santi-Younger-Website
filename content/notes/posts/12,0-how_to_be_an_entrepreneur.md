To create our own brand successfully the formula is simple but of course not easy: ****To be authentic,**** finding a way to ****match our interests with what society wants.****

Then we must leverage our work, through ****connecting with others and finding a way to reach an audience.****

****Putting our name on it,**** this means we will take the ****risks**** but you get the ****rewards**** by taking ****ownership**** of our work.
