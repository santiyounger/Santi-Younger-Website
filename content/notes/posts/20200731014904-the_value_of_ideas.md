**It's not just ideas that matter, it's how they make us feel.** We often hear the classic: _"Ideas have no value unless you execute on them."_ This makes sense from a monetary stand point, but ideas have the power to bring us joy, energy and life, if that isn't meaningful I don't know what is.

**Learn to respect your ideas for the inherent value that they have.**

Execute on the best ones, but don't look down on the ones you don't act on. They are worth more than you think. **Some of them could one day connect with each other and bring to life something unique.**
