****The wish to hide information that ends up in making it popular.****
This term is named after ****Barba Streisand**** who filed a lawsuit on a photographer taking a drone photo of her home in Malibu in 2005. (Yes, drones already existed).

Originally only 6 people have downloaded the photo, after the controversy half a million people shared it online. (Remember this is 2005 so that's a lot.)

The guy who created the the term received a claim from a hotel for taking a photo of a urinal. That's another story for another time.
