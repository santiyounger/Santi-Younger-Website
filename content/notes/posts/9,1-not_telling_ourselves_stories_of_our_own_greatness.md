Not to tell ourselves stories of own greatness. This feeds the ego. We strive to be able to say in the future. 'I always knew what was coming, all of my struggleswere part of the plan.'

**We need to be more humble than that,** not tell ourselves stories of our own greatness. To live in the moment with the humility to recognize how little we know about the outcome of our current actions.
