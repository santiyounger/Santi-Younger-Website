I was with my family going to the parking lot after going to the cinema.

There was a little kid who seemed to be lost, she couldn't find her mom.

We approached her and asked her.

Where's your mom, are you lost?

She said, I'm not lost, I am here, my mom is the one that's lost.

Her mom found her a few seconds after that. That phrase became an inside joke
in my family, but I guess she had a point.

We are never lost of ourselves, we are always where we are.
