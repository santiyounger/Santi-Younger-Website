Eponymous law refers to a  concept that is named after a person, place or thing. Perhaps the most common example is **Murphy's Law:**
> "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong".

There are several amazing laws like this.

This page is my work in progress place to link to different eponymous laws mentioned in my blog.
