 I just got back from my first walk. It was an awesome experience I can't remember the last time I walked for it's own sake.
I usually walk for one of the following purposes:

-   to get somewhere
-   dog walk


## Thoughts {#thoughts}

I didn't try to purposefully think about any problem in particular. Naturally my urge to turn everything I do into some creative idea lead me down a strange path.

I wanted to do this 30 day walk challenge to build the habit of walking. I thought it would be cool to write a blogpost about my experience.
This quickly got out of control into the following thoughts.

-   I can track my daily thoughts
-   I can measure data on things like time, distance
-   I can go even further, tracking my mood per day

    It quickly got out of hand into the full fledged blogpost that you are reading right now.


## Rules {#rules}

-   No phone allowed
-   Most walks in the week need to be alone
